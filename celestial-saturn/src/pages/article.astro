        DAY 1 – URBAN VIBES & HIDDEN GEMS
      </h2>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 28px; font-size:14px;">
        <b>Breakfast at Five Elephant (Kreuzberg)</b><br />
        Kick off your day with specialty coffee and a slice of their famous cheesecake
        at Five Elephant. The café’s relaxed, minimalist design makes it perfect
        to get into a creative workspace, sketch, or just people-watch the streets.<br
        /><br />

        <b>Street art tours & East Side Gallery & YAAM</b><br />
        Join a graffiti tour or stroll along what remains of the East Side Gallery
        – the world’s longest open-air mural. Soak up Berlin’s street art history.
        For lunch and good vibes, relax on the riverside at YAAM (Young African Art
        Market), where graffiti walls, live music, and food stalls create a colorful,
        multicultural atmosphere.<br /><br />

        <b>Co-working hubs & boutiques (Kreuzberg)</b><br />
        If you’re into focus zones with an artsy open-space vibe, grab a pass at
        betahaus. This co-working hub buzzes with young programmers, designers, and
        makers. Their green courtyard and affordable vegan snacks and smoothies are
        perfect for recharging mid-day.<br /><br />

        <b>Lunch at Burgermesiter</b><br />
        Located in the railway tracks in Kreuzberg, Burgermeister serves some of
        the city’s best burgers from what used to be a public restroom – quirky,
        raw, and very Berlin.<br /><br />

        <b>Afternoon at Voo Store & Five Elephant (Neukölln)</b><br />
        Time for shopping and more treats at Five Elephant in Neukölln. The iconic
        1960s building has serene vintage charm. It is both bright and clean, with
        interiors that feel straight out of a design magazine.

        DAY 2 – ART, CULTURE & CHILL
      </h2>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 28px; font-size:14px;">
        <b>Morning coffee at The Barn (Mitte)</b><br />
        Start your second day at The Barn, one of Berlin’s most famous roasteries.
        Their industrial-chic café is popular with designers and students who want
        to sip coffee and sketch ideas while people-watching.<br /><br />

        <b>Art: König Galerie & Hamburger Bahnhof</b><br />
        Spend your late morning exploring König Galerie, a innovative contemporary
        art gallery housed in a converted Brutalist church. For something heady,
        check out Hamburger Bahnhof (Berlin’s Museum for Actual Art), where you’ll
        want to sketch by Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, and rising European talent.<br
        /><br />

        <b>Afternoon at Mauerpark</b><br />
        Sundays in Mauerpark are legendary. Browse the market stalls for vintage
        clothes, flip through old magazines, or just sit on the grass while live
        musicians strum away. If you’re brave, step up on the karaoke stage – Berlin
        tradition!<br /><br />

        <b>Close the day: Klunkerkranich (Neukölln rooftop)</b><br />
        End the day with dinner near Neukölln’s Heimathafen, a buzzing indoor market
        hall. On street food nights, head up to the Klunkerkranich rooftop and set
        up while snacking, mix art installations and exciting nightlife.<br
        /><br />

        <b>Nightlife tip: Berghain Kantine or Sisyphos</b><br />
        If you want the classic Berlin experience, dip into the notorious Berghain
        queues, try Sisyphos for something more chill and décor is stylish. Sisyphos
        is a converted club with art markets and music stages. Both are popular with
        the creative crowd.

        INSIDER & BUDGET TIPS
      </h2>
      <ul style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom: 26px;">
        <li>
          Many galleries (like Hamburger Bahnhof) offer free entry on Thursdays
          after 6 pm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Berlin’s metro app NextStop is great for indie-friendly creative
          routes through overlooked neighborhoods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pack a smartphone, charger, and notebook – grab a 48-hour ticket for
          unlimited U-Bahn and trams all zones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make room design books and zines, don’t miss old mural itself in
          Mitte’s creative bookshops (book shopping is an art and vacation
          ritual…)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Two days in Berlin will only scratch the surface, but by focusing on
        creative spaces, local cafés, and quirky hangouts, you’ll learn to fall
        in love the city very gently. Berlin is place where art is everywhere –
        on the walls, in the clubs, in the food market – and it’s the perfect
        escape for young creatives looking to recharge and get inspired.
